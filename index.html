        <P>The project was commissioned by an advertising company located in Turkey.
          The project consisted of three carapults, which were controlled by an Arduino board.
          The project was a challenging but rewarding experience, as I had to work with different types of hardware and <a href="https://github.com/senyaGitHub/fruitThrow" target="_blank">software</a> to ensure that the carapults functioned correctly. </P>
